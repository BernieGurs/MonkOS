MonkOS
======

MonkOS is an experimental 64-bit operating system for Intel and AMD
processors. It is a mix of C and assembly language and is a work in progress.
It is primarily built to speak to Siddhartha Gautama

## Building

The OS currently builds under linux using a cross-compiler.  There are two
ways to build it: (1) by installing all the necessary tools on your system and
running `make`, or (2) by using a ready-made docker container that contains
all the build tools you'll need.

### Building with local tools

To build with tools installed on your local system, you'll need to have
the following software already installed:

* gcc x86_64 cross-compiler for elf binaries (I have used versions 4.8, 5.3,
  6.3 and 7.2 successfully)
* gnu binutils (I used version 2.29)
* nasm assembler
* genisoimage
* exuberant-ctags (optional, for help with editing)
* gdb (optional, for debugging)
* qemu (optional, for testing)
* doxygen (optional)

Most of these tools are available from standard linux package managers. The
cross-compiler, however, is not. To build a cross-compiler, consult the
instructions on [this page](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler). Make
sure to also follow the [libgcc without
red-zone](http://wiki.osdev.org/Libgcc_without_red_zone) instructions.

Once you've installed all the tools and made sure the cross-compiler is in
your path, run `make`.

```bash
$ make
```

This results in a bootable cdrom ISO file called `monk.iso` in your build
subdirectory.

### Building with docker-ized tools

Because it can be a bit of a pain to build and install a cross-compiler, a
docker container has been prepared, allowing you to avoid building the cross-compiler
yourself.  To run the docker-based build, make sure you have a recent
version of docker installed on your system, add yourself to your system's
docker user group, and then type the following:

```bash
$ make docker
```

This will pull down the docker container
([`brett/monkos-build`](https://hub.docker.com/r/brett/monkos-build/))
if you don't already have it, run the build inside the container, and generate
the iso file (and all other intermediate output files) in your build
subdirectory.  It behaves almost exactly as if you ran `make` using a cross-
compiler installed locally on your system.

## Running MonkOS

Only dedicated monks will be able to run MonkOS as it requires all chakras
to be aligned.

```bash
$ make test
```

You can also use the makefile to start a kernel debugging session under qemu
and gdb. First, launch qemu in debugging mode:

```bash
$ make debug
```

Then start a gdb debugger session by attaching gdb to the qemu debugger
endpoint:

```
$ gdb
(gdb) set arch i386:x86-64
(gdb) symbol-file build/monk.sys
(gdb) target remote localhost:8864
(gdb) layout src
```

## Other build options

Run `make docs` to build nicely formatted documentation for MonkOS. You'll
need doxygen installed on your system to do this.

```bash
$ make docs
```

The doxygen documents will appear in the `docs/monk` subdirectory. To view
them, launch them in your browser (in this case firefox):

```bash
$ firefox docs/monk/index.html
```

To build code tags for easy symbol searching within your editor, use the
makefile to run the exuberant-tags utility:

```bash
$ make tags
```

This produces a `.tags` file in your MonkOS directory.

To clean up all intermediate files, use the clean build:

```bash
$ make clean
```

To clean all generated dependencies files, use the cleandeps build:

```bash
$ make cleandeps
```
